## Unreleased
### Added
- The new `ListenerException` class can be thrown from event listeners as a shortcut to stop events.
- A `deleted` property has been added to soft deleted models.
- The `Query::one()` method finds exactly one model or throws an exception.
- The `Query::oneOrNull()` method finds exactly one model or returns null.
- Capture the options of the failing validation rule for more accurate error messages.
- Added `Iterator::toArray()` as a shortcut to `iterator_to_array`
- `Query::where()` now accepts models as conditions
- Doctrine 3 compatibility if using the DBAL driver
- Added `Model::deleteOrFail()` method.
- The model ID property names can be obtained with `Definition::getIds()`

### Changed
- Moved adding event listeners and dispatching events to `EventManager`
- Queries against models that support soft deletes now return all models by default. Use `::withoutDeleted()` to exclude deleted models from a query.
- Soft delete logic has been moved to the `SoftDelete` trait
- Use @mixin instead of @method for query operations on model
- `Query::first()` now returns an array of results when the limit is 1
- Added return typehint to `AclModel::hasPermission()`
- PHP 8.1 is required at minimum
- Changed all `BadMethodCallException` to `ModelException`
- `Query::set()` and `Query::delete()` now throw  an exception if any operation fails
- Queries attempt to detect and prevent duplicate joins
- Model ID properties are now provided by `Model::getIDProperties()` instead of `Model::$ids`. `Model::getIDProperties()` is now a protected method instead of public.
- Model properties are now provided by `Model::getProperties()` instead of `Model::$properties`
- Any `autoDefinition` methods should return an array of properties that will be added to the list of model properties
- The constructor arguments to `Property` are now typed and promoted to constructor properties. An array of properties is no longer accepted.
- Property definitions must return `Property` objects instead of arrays

### Fixed
- Rollback database transaction after uncaught exception during model persistence.
- The return types of average, min, max, and sum in the database drivers was incorrect.
- The model is unmarked as persisted if the post-create listener fails.
- The iterator no longer returns null values in a foreach loop.

### Removed
- `Model::getDispatcher()` was removed and replaced with the `EventManager` class.
- `Model::$hidden`, `Model::$appended`, `Model::$permitted`, and `Model::$protected` were removed.

## 0.11 - 2020-07-26
### Added
- You can now supply your own translation implementation with `TranslatorInterface`. A simple translation implementation is provided with Pulsar.
- The `Errors::setTranslator()` method can set the global translation implementation.
- Models now have a `buildDefinition()` method that can be overridden to dynamically customize the model properties.
- Added `Model::dirty()` to check for unsaved values, and detect changes to those values.
- Added `Type::*`, `Property::*`, and `Relationship::*` constants to replace removed `Model` constants.
- New method `Model::hasId()` will indicate when a model has a complete identifier.
- Model definitions have new shortcuts to define relationships: `belongs_to`, `belongs_to_many`, `has_many`, `has_one`, and `morphs_to`.
- Added `encrypt` validation rule to encrypt values prior to saving to database using defuse/php-encryption.
- Added `encrypt` setting to model definitions that when enabled will encrypt the property value in the database.
- Added polymorphic relationship type.
- Saved values are no longer validated by `Model::valid()`. Only unsaved values will be validated.
- Callable validation rules can now set their own validation error message.
- Added `Model::beforePersist()` and `Model::afterPersist()` shortcut to install lifecycle event listeners for all create, update, and delete.
- Added `Model::getMassAssignmentWhitelist()` and `Model::getMassAssignmentBlacklist()` that can be overriden to define mass assignment rules.
- Added `in_array` model definition setting to indicate whether a property is included in the array representation.
- Added `enum` model property type.

### Changed
- Make model internal properties private when possible.
- The package no longer depends on `infuse/libs`.
- Renamed `Property` class to `Type`.
- A new `Definition` class contains all the properties that belong to a method. Retrieving the model properties with `Model::definition()` will return this object instead of an array.
- A new `Property` class encapsulates the definition of a model property. The model property methods will return this object instead of an array.
- Moved `Model::cast()` to `Type::cast()`
- Marked classes as final when appropriate.
- The model constructor no longer has an `$id` argument. Instead you can use `new Model(['id' => 1234])`.
- Changed the structure of the `validate` property setting to be an array with named options.
- The unique constraint is now a validation rule specified as: `['validate' => ['unique', 'column' => 'email']]`.
- Callable validation rules must now be specified as: `['validate' => ['callable', 'fn' => ...]]`.
- The error stack represents error messages as objects instead of arrays.
- Lifecycle events are now represented as a different class for each event type.
- Automatic timestamps are now installed with the `AutoTimestamps` trait.
- Soft delete is now enabled with the `SoftDelete` trait.
- Deprecated `Model::$hidden`, `Model::$appended`, `Model::$permitted`, and `Model::$protected`.\
- All class properties, method arguments, and method return values have type hints.

### Fixed
- Use a strict equality check when casting an empty string to null on a nullable property. Previously this would check for a falsey value.
- Ensure `Model::definition()` is always called in static context

### Removed
- Removed `Errors::setLocale`, `Errors::getLocale()`, and `Errors::setGlobalLocale()`. It is now required to use `Errors::setTranslator()`.
- Removed the `toArrayHook()` call. It is recommended to override `toArray()` if it is necessary to modify its output.
- Removed `Model::TYPE_*`, `Model` mutability, and `Model::RELATIONSHIP_*` constants.
- Removed `Model::getProperties()`, `::hasProperty()`, and `::getProperty()`.
- Removed the `password_php` validation rule in favor of `password`.
- It is no longer possible to supply a locale when grabbing error messages.
- Removed the `ModelEvent` class.

## 0.10 - 2020-04-22
### Added
- Added a DBAL driver.
- Model operations will now be wrapped in database transactions by overriding the `Model::usesTransactions()` method. 

### Changed
- Added argument and return type hinting to most methods.

### Fixed
- Ensure that the array property type always returns an array

### Removed
- Removed the `DriverException::getException()` method in favor of `getPrevious()`.
- Removed the number property type. Use integer or float instead.
- Removed `exists()` on model class.
- Removed `title` setting on model properties.
- Removed `ACLModel::setRequester()` and `ACLModel::getRequester()`
- Removed `Errors::errors()`, `Errors::messages()`, and `Errors::push()`
- Removed `Query::totalRecords()`
- Removed the `preSetHook()` method call during the `model.updating` event. If you need to use this functionality install the below event listener in your model.
  ```php
   use Pulsar\Event\AbstractEvent;

   self::updating(function (AbstractEvent $modelEvent) {
     $model = $modelEvent->getModel();
     if (!$model->preSetHook($model->_unsaved)) {
         $modelEvent->stopPropagation();
     }
   }, -512);
   ```
